			<h3 class="centered">Exponential Growth</h3>
			The more users that use Semaphore, the faster it grows. Semaphore is designed to make it natural to bring in new users: sending money to someone not in the system is exactly the same as someone who is in the system. Users are also encouraged to make an account before they recieve anything, encouraging even faster growth.
			<h3 class="centered">Increasing Demand</h3>
			All transactions that go through Semaphore use Semaphore's block chain token, meaning that as Semaphore's user base grows, the token price will go up as well.
			<h3 class="centered">Controlled Supply</h3>
			Users are incentivized to keep money inside the system, ensuring that supply never floods out demand.<br><br>

		<h2 class="centered">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<ul id="faq">
			<li>What makes Semaphore more than "Tinder with a blockchain?"</li>
			<div>
				Semaphore has fundamentally different goals than traditional dating apps. It intends to expand its scope beyond just romantic interest, but even within the realm of matching romantic partners, Semaphore is about “discovering hidden connections” rather than pairing up strangers. Tinder matches involve very little commitment, and many users find their time wasted with frivolous pairings. Semaphore focuses on people who already know each other and want to determine whether some feeling or belief is mutual.
			</div>
			<li>Why require money for matches when existing services are free?</li>
			<div>
				Offering up money serves adds a cost to Semaphore matches, which is an effective way to demonstrate that the signalled belief is genuine. Without this kind of commitment, there would be nothing stopping someone from signalling everything to everyone, just to see what responses they get back, and the whole system becomes unreliable. From an individual's perspective, spending a small amount of money will ensure that any response is genuine, a service that they can't get anywhere else.
			</div>
			<li>Why would the average person have any interest in Semaphore?</li>
			<div>
				Even if nothing else about the platform interests someone, there's always the lure of potential free money. A key feature of Semaphore is that users anonymously receive the money that other people commit when matching with them. Someone who is popular, well-connected, or attractive has a chance to earn money by signing up for Semaphore and evangelizing it to their peers. In this sense, Semaphore markets itself.
			</div>
			<li>Doesn't Semaphore rely too heavily on "network effects" to be useful?</li>
			<div>
				Not particularly. A user wishing to signal to someone without a Semaphore account provides some of that person's contact information, and they receive an explanation of what Semaphore is and instructions on signing up. The money they can claim provides an incentive for them to sign up and see what Semaphore is about. Additionaly, Semaphore doesn't provide users with information on who else has an account, so a large set of users is not needed to preserve anonymity.
			</div>
			<li>Why is blockchain technology useful for this application?</li>
			<div>
				As a distributed application, Semaphore is trustless. There is no private data stored in a central database. Instead, match information is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, with the potential for further obfuscation using zk-SNARKs. As countless hacks (such as Ashley Madison in 2015) have demonstrated, centralized databases are a liability when it comes to this kind of information.
			</div>
			<li>Who's behind Semaphore?</li>
			<div>
				Semaphore was imagined and designed by Dennis Maloney, a Computer Science and Economics student at MIT. Development of Semaphore is a collaboration between Dennis and Kent Slaney, another computer science student at MIT.
			</div>
			<li>What's the meaning of the name Semaphore?</li>
			<div>
				A semaphore is a signal, and Semaphore is a platform for sending reliable signals. Additionally, "semaphore" has a technical meaning within the realm of computer science. Computer programs are often split up into separate threads that run at the same time. A semaphore is a variable used to make sure that different threads don't access and change a common resource at the same time, which would cause problems in the program. Semaphore serves an analogous role: it controls access to information in a manner that ensures no one gets hurt.
			</div>
			<li>Is there any significance behind the graphic on the front page?</li>
			<div>
				Yes, actually. The public/private key algorithm typically used by blockchains relies on elliptic curve cryptography, the continuous version of which is illustrated by the graphic. If you're interested, you can read more about elliptic curve cryptography in <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/" target="_blank">this Cloudflare blog post</a>.
			</div>
			<li>Is Semaphore open source?</li>
			<div>
				Yes, Semaphore's source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Semaphore-Co/Semaphore" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
