			<h3 class="centered">Exponential Growth</h3>
			The more people that use Semaphore, the faster it grows, and Semaphore is designed to naturally bring in new users. Sending tokens to someone without an account is just as easy as sending to someone with one. New recipients must make an account to claim tokens, encouraging growth.
			<h3 class="centered">Increasing Demand</h3>
			Using Semaphore requires the Semaphore token, so as Semaphore's user base grows, the token price will likely increase.
			<h3 class="centered">Fixed Supply</h3>
			After the ICO, no further Semaphore tokens will be created. Additionally, users are incentivized to keep tokens inside the application, keeping the supply of tokens on exchanges low.<br><br>

						<p>Up to 7,000,000 tokens will be sold during the ICO. The price of tokens will be determined closer to the time of the sale. Unsold tokens will not be minted, reducing the total supply.</p>

				<h2 class="centered">Use of Pre-ICO Funds</h2>
				<ul class="large-list">
					<li>Development</li>
						<p>Semaphore looks to expand its team with skilled developers. Blockchain technologies are still maturing, creating awkward situations such as the need for browser extensions to run DApps. We will strive to create the most seamless possible user experience despite these constraints.</p>
					<li>SEC Compliance</li>
						<p>Semaphore wants its primary ICO to be as freely available as possible. We will look into getting a Regulation D or Regulation A+ offering approved by the SEC to enable United States citizens to participate.</p>
					<li>Marketing</li>
						<p>Semaphore needs users to be successful, and marketers will help introduce it to people.</p>

		<ul class="large-list">
			<li>Acquire some Ether</li>
			<p>If you're new to Ethereum, <a href="https://ethereumprice.org/how-to-buy-ethereum/">here's a great guide to buying Ethereum.</a></p>
			<li>Send your Ether to the smart contract address from a personal wallet</li>
			<p>The smart contract address will be published on this page when the Pre-ICO begins.</p>
			<p><b>Do not send Ether from an exchange.</b> You must use a personal wallet if you want to receive your tokens or be able to refund your investment. The smart contract will automatically track your contribution.</p>
			<li>Remember your private key</li>
			<p>The address you send Ether from is the one which will receive the tokens, so be sure to maintain access to it. You will be able to verify your contribution and have it refunded if desired, until the conclusion of the sale, via a form on this page.</p>
			<li>Your address automatically receives ERC20 tokens</li>
			<p>After the Semaphore token launches, you'll receive the appropriate number of tokens at your address.</p>
